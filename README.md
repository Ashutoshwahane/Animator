## How to Use

BouncyCompose is a Jetpack Compose function that creates a bouncing animation effect for a provided content within a Compose UI. The animation simulates the movement of an element within a defined screen area, bouncing back when reaching the boundaries.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun BouncyCompose(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier, 
    screenWidth: Dp = Dp(300f), 
    screenHeight: Dp = Dp(500f), 
    content: @Composable () -> Unit, 
    speedXPosition: Float = 2.0f, 
    speedYPosition: Float = 2.0f
)
```


HeartBeatCompose is a Jetpack Compose function that creates a heartbeat animation effect for a provided content within a Compose UI. The animation simulates the pulsation of an element, expanding and contracting in size.
```kotlin
@Composable
fun HeartBeatCompose(modifier: Modifier = Modifier, content: @Composable () -> Unit)
```
